                        We open on a prologue, in which the narrator speaks in third person to describe a little boy and a little girl, immediately establishing that our female protagonist is fragile and quirky. Then we enter Chapter 1, where everything is in first person because we are now looking at the world from the perspective of our not-like-the-other-girls-scrawny-yet-fiesty main character Alina Starkov. We find that she is a mapmaker in the army, and she is about to enter the Shadow Fold, an expanse of darkness created by some evil guy a long time ago. On the Fold, Alina witnesses many deaths. But soon enough, she finds out that there is a hidden power brewing inside her. In a world of magic-wielding first-rank soldiers, our main character must discover more about herself and the mysterious Darkling who has taken an interest in her, all with her childhood friend Mal at her side. im tired

                        Words in Deep Blue is a contemporary romance book that follows the perspectives of two old friends finding each other in a second-hand bookstore. It has a beautiful, soft feeling to the story as the characters' relationship evolves, traversing the complicatedness of healing from loss in many different ways. It's a book where sitting in the garden in the sun gives you lifelong memories :) READ IT.
